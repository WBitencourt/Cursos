## ðŸ’» Project
Application initially developed by the Rocketseat Team aimed at creating a Widget for users to leave feedback about the page they are visiting.

## ðŸ¤“ Personal Objective
By participating in the 8th edition of NLW, I was challenged by Rocketseat to extend the original project by adding new functionalities.
<br />
After a lot of learning at the event, I decided to throw my hat over the wall and go fetch it (Phrases from Diego.com haha).
<br />
I thought about using this project somewhere it would really make sense, and I realized the NLW website did not have this functionality, so I did it. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜…
<br />
Of course, I tried to simulate as closely as possible within the available time something similar to the NLW page. And it was worth it; I learned more tools and ways to develop an application, all the learning was listed in the topics below.
